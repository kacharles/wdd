            Hi! My name is Charles. I like talking to people and inspring them
            to achieve their widest dream. I work as a mentor at Bloom serving
            <a href="https://byupathway.org">BYU-Pathway worldwide Stuents</a>. 
            One thing I like about my job is the opportunity it provides me to 
            listen, empathize, and be an encouragement to others while helping them
            to continue their education regardless of the challenges they encounter. 
            I am also a student at BYU-Idaho online studying software development. 
            I like quotations and I have a collection of quotes. Here's one for you: <br>
            &quot;Don't be afraid to be &lt; 100% success. You have everything to
            gain and nothing to loose. Go for it. ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž &quot; -Charles Alfred Koenig.
