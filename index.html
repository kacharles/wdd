        <p>Hi! I am Charles Alfred Koenig. I enjoy talking to people and inspiring others to 
            believe in themselves and achieve their wildest dream. I am currently working
            for Bloom as a mentor serving <a href="https://byupathway.org">BYU-Pathway Worldwide students</a>. 
            One thing I like about my job is the opportunity it provides me to listen, empathize and 
            be an encouragement to others while inspiring them to rise about their situation. 
            I am a student. I am currenlty enrolled at BYU-Idaho(online) studying web development. 
            I like this course. It helps bring out my creativity and help me to hone my problem solving 
            skills by planning and designing attractive and appealing websites. I also like quotes. 
            I have a collection of quotes. Here's one for you: <br>

            &quot;Don't be afraid to be &lt; 100% success! You have nothing to loose and everything
            to gain.&quot; - Charles Alfred Koenig. Nice to meet you. 
        </p>
